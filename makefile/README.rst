About
-----
This folder contains an example Makefile for building and using the
Kodo C bindings. The Makefile can be useful if you wish to build the
Kodo C bindings without the provided Waf build scripts.

To use the Makefile, you might have to update the variables
according to your directory layout and build system.

The Makefile builds two targets:
1. The ``libckodo.a`` static library containing the Kodo C bindings.
2. The ``encode_decode_example`` binary which is a C application provided
   in the examples folder demonstrating the use of the bindings API.
